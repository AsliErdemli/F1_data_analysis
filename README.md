# F1_data_analysis
Analysing F1 open data for fun! 

# Project description 
Welcome to F1 data analysis. For those who might not know me well, I like Jane Austen, Fernando Alonso, and data analysis, in that order.   
This is a project where I will challenge myself to answer simple questions using Formula 1 data. 

Examples of questions are : 
- How many seconds did Oscar Piastri lose by not pitting the same time as Lando Norris on Silverstone 2024 British GP?
- How bad was Charles Leclerc's pace compared to Carlos Sainz ? 
- What was the race pace difference between Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton?
